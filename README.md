# spy_analysis

-The purpose of this project is to compare growth outcomes between two common capital deployment strategies Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) and Lump Sum Investing (LSI).

-We use historical price and dividend data for the S&P 500 exchange traded fund (SPY) to model historical investment outcomes of these two stratgeies over
several different time horizons.

-To avoid heavily biasing our analysis results to overrepresent past market conditions that are unrelated to current conditions we have chosen to limit our modeling
to only include data in the last 30 years.
