-The purpose of this project is to compare total return growth outcomes between two common capital deployment strategies, Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) and
Lump Sum Investing (LSI).

-We use historical price and dividend data for the S&P 500 exchange traded fund (SPY) to model historical total return growth outcomes of these two strategies over
varying investment horizons.

-We then sample the distribution of investment outcomes to determine the probabilistically optimal investment strategy for varying investment horizons.

-We also examine the risk profile of competing strategies by quantifying the frequency and intensity of low probability but high cost events.
